This textbook is intended as a companion guide to CSCI 104: Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design at the University of Southern California.
CSCI 104 is typically taken in the second semester of freshman year or the first semester of sophomore year.
Students enrolled in this class are expected to be familiar with structural programming in the C++ programming language.
In addition to basic command of the language, this includes dynamic memory management and recursion.
While these two topics are covered in the opening chapters and are typically covered for about one lecture each, a student not already familiar with them is likely to struggle in the class.

This textbook grew out of class notes provided for the students in CSCI 104 in the fall semester of 2013.
These notes represent the specific way in which we like to present the material: by motivating object-oriented design primarily from the point of view of implementing data structures.
There tends to be greater focus on analysis and allusions to advanced topics than in a typical, programming-heavy data structures course for undergraduates.

These notes are based on lecture notes taken by Douglass Chen, Chandler Baker, Nakul Joshi, April Luo, Peter Zhang, and Jennie Zhou of fall 2013.
The notes were subsequently expanded significantly by David Kempe.

In fall 2020, the CSCI 104 course staff expanded and modernized the course notes with the intent to approach a more textbook-like format.
The existing chapters saw improvements to depth, accessibility, and maintainability, and new content was added to reflect changes to the curriculum made under professor Sandra Batista.
Noah Kim and Michelle Wong led this effort.
